### Stage 3 - REACT NATIVE

In this stage we created the application's mobile front-end using React Native. In addition, we created our project using TypeScript and Expo which provides a lot of development productivity.

### ğŸ§ª Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

### âœ¨ Features

- [x] Connection to backend on Node.js
- [x] Real time connection with `Socket.io`
- [x] Authentication flow with `Github OAuth` and React `Context API`
- [x] Message waiting list that prevents too much flow of information

### ğŸš€ How execute

> Note: Inside the folder (mobile > src > services > api.ts) you must put your machine ip - eg: http://yourIPV4:4000. To find the ipv4 and just open the cmd and ipconfig and get the ipv4

Obs: Inside the folder (src > hooks > auth.tsx) in `const CLIENT_ID` put your key that was generated by github.

- Change the Client ID in `src>configs>env.ts` file
- Change OAuth settings from Github `Homepage URL` and `Authorization callback URL` to:
```
https://auth.expo.io/@YOUR-EXPO-USERNAME/APP-NAME
```
- Follow the commands:
```
# Clone the project:
$git clone https://github.com/sestevao/nlw_heat/mobile

# Enter directory:
$cd mobile

# Install dependencies:
$ yarn

# Run the application:
$expo start
```

Now you can connect your mobile device with QR Code or run an emulator on your PC.

It is necessary to have the expo downloaded -> https://expo.io/
