### Stage 1 - NODE.JS

In this Stage of **NLW Heat** we created the backend of the application using NodeJS using Typescript that helps to increase productivity in development, Prisma ORM to work with database and Socket.IO to work communication in real time.

### ðŸ§ª Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

### âœ¨ Features

- [x] Routing with Express.js
- [x] Relational database of users and messages with Prism
- [x] Real-time connection for sending and receiving messages with Socket.io
- [x] Authentication flow with Github OAuth and JWT web token

### ðŸš€ How execute

- To work both web and mobile it is necessary to leave the backend running.
- We need to create an `.env` in the folder **backend** and put the following environment variables `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` both generated by github and `JWT_SECRET`, MD5 hash, a random key.
- To run on the Web when creating keys on github at `Homepage URL` put (http://localhost:4000) and at `Authorization callback URL` put (http://localhost:3000)
- To run on mobile when creating keys in github at `Homepage URL` and `Authorization callback URL` put the following url (https://auth.expo.io/@YourUsersExpo/appName) eg: https://auth.expo.io/@testeExpo/nlwheatapp

```
# Access the project folder in the terminal
$ cd server

# Install dependencies
$ npm install or yarn

#Run the application
$ yarn dev
```

The app will be running on port 4000.

> Note: In this project we have authentication via [OAuth with GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)

- Clone the repository and access the folder;
- Create an `.env` file and fill it in with your GitHub credentials
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
  - `JWT_SECRET`, MD5 hash;
- Install dependencies with `yarn`;
- Execute migrations with `yarn prisma migrate dev`;
- If you want to see migrations use `yarn prisma studio`;
- Start the server with `yarn dev`;

The application can be accessed at `localhost:4000`.
