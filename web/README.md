### Stage 2 - REACT JS

In this stage we created the web front-end of the application using ReactJS. Furthermore, we created our project using Vite, an extremely high-performance tool, TypeScript and CSS modules.

### ðŸ§ª Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### âœ¨ Features

- [x] Connection to backend on Node.js
- [x] Real time connection with `Socket.io`
- [x] Authentication flow with `Github OAuth` and React `Context API`
- [x] Message waiting list that prevents too much flow of information

### ðŸš€ How execute

> Note: To run this project we have to run the `server` backend.

- Inside the folder (src > contexts > auth.tsx) in `const signInUrl` on line (36), after `client_id=` put your key that was generated by gihub.
- Install dependencies with `yarn`
- Start the server with `yarn dev`

You can now access `localhost:3000` from your browser.
