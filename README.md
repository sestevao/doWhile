## 💻 About the project

Project developed during NLW (Next Level Week) on the Impulse track, where this week an application was built from scratch backend, frontend and mobile, an intense week full of content, but it was a great learning experience, as I learned a lot about how to integrate all areas that were still having a bit of difficulty at this point, an incredible experience, very cool, each day one more day of learning, looking forward to the next. 🚀🚀🚀

## ✅ Getting started

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- yarn is optional [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/).
- Also it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### 🔒 Running the back end (server)

Clone this repository

To work both web and mobile it is necessary to leave the backend running.

We need to create an .env in the folder **backend** and put the following environment variables `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` both generated by github.

To run on the Web when creating keys on github at `Homepage URL` put (http://localhost:4000) and at `Authorization callback URL` put (http://localhost:3000)

To run on mobile when creating keys in github at `Homepage URL` and `Authorization callback URL` put the following url (https://auth.expo.io/@YourUsersExpo/nameOfTheApp) eg: https://auth.expo.io/@testeExpo/nlwheatapp

```
# Access the project folder in the terminal
$ cd backend

# Install dependencies
$ npm install or yarn

#Run the application
$ yarn dev
```

The app will be running on port 4000.

#### 🌐 Running the web application (front end)

Clone this repository

Inside the folder (frontend) and inside the folder (src) and inside (contexts) in auth.tsx in const signInUrl on line (36), after client_id= put your key that was generated by gihub.

```
# Access the project folder in the terminal
$ cd frontend

# Install dependencies
$ npm install or yarn

# Run the application
$ yarn dev

# The app will be available in your browser at the address - http://localhost:3000
```

### 📱 Running the mobile application

Clone this repository

Note: Inside the folder (mobile > src > services > api.ts) you must put your machine ip - ex: http://yourIPV4:4000. To find the ipv4 and just open the cmd and ipconfig and get the ipv4

Obs: Inside the folder (src > hooks > auth.tsx) in `const CLIENT_ID` put your key that was generated by github.

```
# Access the project folder in the terminal
$ cd mobile

# Install dependencies
$ npm install or yarn
```

It is necessary to have the expo downloaded -> https://expo.io/
